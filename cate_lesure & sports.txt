Each channel features its own individual 3-band EQ and 100Hz low-cut filter for shaping the sound of your inputs. The ReadyFX digital effects engine gives you access to 16 different effects including reverbs and delays - Mackie even added chorus effects for your guitar. A 7-band graphic EQ can be assigned either to your main outputs so you can fine tune the PA, or to the aux output to easily get rid of feedback in your monitors. If you perform with backing tracks, there are inputs (including USB) for your laptop or MP3 player, a headphone output with individual level control, and even phantom power for your condenser mics. With the added convenience of a hi-Z input for direct instrument input, you have no reason NOT to own a ProFX12v2. The ProFX12v2 is exactly what you need for mixing when the gig calls for minimal inputs, but that's not where its usefulness ends. Since you'll be mixing from the stage, keep the ProFX12v2 right next to you, and you can use the headphone output with a set of in-ear monitors for your performance and just leave your floor monitors at home. Drummers can use it for monitoring, too - take the aux mix from the front of house board that would have gone to your wedges and plug it in to a channel on the ProFX12v2.", ["Be sure that the volume of the input is the same as it would be during normal use, or you may have to readjust the gain in the middle of a set", "6 low-noise Mackie Vita mic preamps add life to any input.
