Best of all, the machine's timer can be set to delay the end of the baking cycle by up to 13 hours, which makes it possible to wake up to the smell of freshly baked, homemade bread in the morning or to come home to a warm loaf at the end of a long day at the office. The bread maker provides two blades for thorough dough kneading and a higher rise, a large viewing window, an \"on\" indicator light, a start/reset button, and a removable nonstick bread pan for easy cleaning. A double-ended teaspoon/tablespoon measuring spoon, an 8-ounce measuring cup, and a user manual with a variety of recipes come included.   Bake a Variety of Recipes From cinnamon-raisin bread for breakfast to buttery dinner rolls or garlic bread sticks to serve with dinner, this counter top appliance makes it easy to create delicious bakery-style artisan bread right at home. It can even be used to make homemade meatloaf, strawberry jam, chocolate cake, and more.   Pizza    Strawberry Jam    Meatloaf     Pre-Programmed Baking Options Breads, cakes and other menu options are pre-programmed. In certain models, you can also program your own cycles as well.

Dough Prepares dough for you to shape and bake in the oven. Enjoy fun recipes such as pizza, bagels, pretzels and cinnamon rolls.   Bake Bread with Ease  Use Fresh Ingredients First, prepare fresh ingredients. Quality of the finished bread will depend on ingredients used. Avoid mixing in old or stale ingredients. Attach Blades Blades are especially important parts of the breadmakers. Make sure the blades are properly attached. Measure Ingredients Next, measure ingredients accurately. The more accurate the measurements are, the better the finished bread will be. Rough measurements will result in a rough bread.  Add Ingredients in Order Ingredients have lives. There are compatibilities among ingredients, too. Through trials and errors, we found a right order for adding ingredients. Please add in the order of liquids, powders, and yeast to be assured your bread comes out the way you want. Select Course Finally, make sure to choose the right course setting.

You can even lay the top of the grill open to get two 8x8\u201d flat griddle surfaces for eggs, bacon, and more! Adjustable temperature controls ensure you have the right amount of heat for whatever you choose to create.

This BLACK+DECKER 3-in-1 Waffle Maker does it all!\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t    \t\nAmazon.com\nA waffle baker, grill, and griddle, this three-in-one appliance comes in handy during breakfast, lunch, dinner, and after school. Key to the unit's versatility are two 8-inch-square cooking plates--one set into the product's bottom and the other into the hinged top. On one side the plates form grids for making four waffles at once. Flipped over to show their flat sides they're capable of top and bottom grilling a sandwich or steak. To create griddle space, the top opens up flat, forming two 8-inch-square cooking surfaces for all foods that love a griddle--such as pancakes, hash browns, and eggs. Channels send grease to spouts in the griddles' corners, where it drains away. Nonstick to release food easily and wipe clean, the cooking plates also can be removed for scrubbing. A heat control offers high, low, and medium temperatures. With its chrome housing and stay-cool black synthetic handles, this 900-watt appliance looks great on the counter. Afterward, the cord wraps around the hinge, plus you can stand the unit upright for compact storage. It measures 11-1/4 inches wide, 5 inches high, and 11-3/4 inches deep and carries a one-year warranty against defects. The plates will be slightly loose when the lid is open but this is normal with waffle/grill makers that are inter changeable.The plates are secured by little metal clips. The clips secure the plates to the griddle.

Leave top lid open so grids begin to cool. Never take your waffle maker apart for cleaning. Simply brush crumbs from grooves, and absorb any excess cooking oil by wiping with a dry cloth or paper towel. You may clean the grids by wiping with a damp cloth to prevent staining and sticking from batter or oil buildup. Be certain grids have cooled completely before cleaning. If batter adheres to plates, simply pour a little cooking oil onto the baked batter and let stand approximately 5 minutes, thus allowing it to soften for easy removal. To clean exterior, wipe with a soft dry cloth. Never use an abrasive cleanser or harsh pad.    Storage When waffle making is completed, simply store your maker with the cord wrapped securely around base. Plug prongs fit into the special grooves on the side of the waffle maker. For compact storage, stand waffle maker on opening end so Cuisinart logo is facing you. The waffle maker has been designed with a special latching feature so the lid stays closed during storage.   Tips on how to make the perfect waffles Cuisinart recommends the heat setting #3 for golden brown waffles. If you prefer crisper, darker waffles, increase the browning control to setting #4 or 5. For evenly filled waffles, pour the batter onto the center of the lower grid and close the cover. We recommend using 1/2 cup batter per waffle for evenly filled waffles. Waffles are best when made to order, but baked waffles may be kept warm in a 200\u00b0F oven. Place in a baking pan or wrap in foil while in the oven. Waffles wrapped in foil may lose their crispiness. Baked waffles may be frozen. Allow to cool completely, then place in plastic food storage bag. Use waxed paper to keep waffles separated. Reheat in a toaster or toaster oven when ready to use.

This is so heat is stored up and redistributed evenly. The resulting blast of heat from the Old Stone Oven rectangular pizza stone gives bread and pizza a nice chewy crust. The rustic French tarts called galettes are also well suited to a baking stone. To use the stone, place it in a cold oven and preheat to 500 degrees for pizza, or according to the recipe for bread or galettes. The stone is made of the same material that lines blast furnaces and kilns, so it can handle ultra-high temperatures.  Wait until the baking stone is entirely cooled before attempting to clean it. Let it dry completely before using again. Some discoloration will occur over time; this is natural and will not affect baking. Using baking parchment may help delay that discoloration. Do not bake cookies, turnovers or other high-fat items on the stone; the stone would absorb the fat and proceed to produce smoke and bad odors. The stone comes with a flyer that contains detailed use and cleaning instructions, as well as recipes for bread, pizza dough, and two pizza toppings. --Garland Withers", ["Make sure this fits\nby entering your model number.", "Baking stone creates restaurant-quality pizzas and breads", "Bakes up multi-layered crunchy-chewy crusts", "Absorbs heat and transfers it evenly for a perfect bake", "Durable, non-cracking; crafted from a blend of lead-free clays", "Specially engineered Heat Core eliminates soggy centers", "Dimensions: 14.5\u201d L x 16.5\u201d W"], "2,208 ratings", "Available from these sellers.", "", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91y89W379DL._SX679_.jpg"], ["B008M5U1C2", "Victorinox Fibrox Pro Chef's Knife, 8-Inch Chef's FFP", "A TRUSTED FAVORITE Preferred by both home chefs and culinary professionals, the 8\" Fibrox Pro Chef's Knife can handle nearly every kitchen task imaginable.

While Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.

Just push, twist and blend to make almost any smoothie in under 60 seconds.\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAmazon.com\n   The NutriBullet System is quite simply the best product out there to make healthy, nutritious drinks that can help you fight and prevent disease, lose weight, relieve joint pain, promote healthy, younger-looking skin, and even add years to your life. The secret is the NutriBullet\u2019s exclusive extractor technology which uses a 600 watt motor with cyclonic action and the patented extractor blades. This technology breaks down and pulverizes the stems, seeds, and skins where most of the essential nutrition lies \u2013 unlike what juicers and blenders do. Simply add your favorite fruits, vegetables and boosts (nuts, seeds, herbs) to the NutriBullet, along with some water, and extract the ingredients into smooth, tasty drink. And the best part is a NutriBlast takes only seconds to prepare, seconds to clean and couldn\u2019t be easier to take on-the-go. Why extract food? Eating extracted food is great for EVERYONE in any state of health \u2013 from top performing athlete to someone suffering from fibromyalgia \u2013 because extracted food is virtually predigested, so your body can effortlessly absorb and utilize all of the nutrition that food has to offer. Even when we eat the healthiest foods, like a salad for example, it\u2019s a lot of work for the body to break that salad down to get it ready for absorption into the body. When we prepare extracted foods with the NutriBullet, the foods are consumed in their most absorptive state, so we get the nutrition WITHOUT having to rely on proper chewing, effective stomach acids, digestive enzymes and the like to break down the food.

Regardless of our circumstances, jobs, or family commitments we all have exactly 24 hours to use each day. Time is precious and fleeting. It will not wait for any of us to use it up or share with others. Cooking meals and cleaning dishes takes effort and a lot of time. Day-after-day meals need to be made, and then the cleanup begins. It\u2019s a necessary part of life. Blendtec blenders significantly reduce meal prep time and cleanup. When you buy a Blendtec blender you\u2019re not only buying the world\u2019s most advanced blender, you\u2019re also buying yourself more time. How can a blender give you more time? It comes down to technology and design. Our advanced technology and jar design create a vortex, which pulls food towards the blade instead of pushing it to the sides of the jar like our competitors. With Blendtec jars, you won\u2019t waste time tending your blends with a tamper to get all the ingredients down into the blades, and no tamper means one less thing to clean when you\u2019re done. Blendtec blenders can also heat your food during the blend cycle. For instance, if you want soup for dinner, a Blendtec blender can blend it up and heat it up at the same time so it\u2019s ready to serve straight from the blender jar. No need to heat your soup in a pan. Can your old blender do that? No pan and no additional heating time means less cleanup. Not only can Blendtec blenders heat your food, they can also make ice cream. Actual ice cream can be made with the exact same blender that makes soup. Drinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts can all be made with the same blender using the same jar. The time it takes to make each course could be measured in seconds not minutes or hours. Cleanup for an entire multi-course meal could be as simple as pushing the pre-programmed, self-cleaning button to wash a single jar, and just like that, you\u2019ll be done. There is a reason that having the world's most technologically advanced blender is worth every penny, it gives you more time to focus on life and the people who matter to you.
